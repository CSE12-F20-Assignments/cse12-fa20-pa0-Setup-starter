# PA0 (Optional): Computer Setup
---

This assignment will teach you how to setup Java and Eclipse, get the starter code from GitHub, and how to run Eclipse projects.

It is due on Wednesday, October 7th at 11:59pm. No submission for this assignment.

## Download Java & Eclipse

Follow this document to install Java and Eclipse for either Windows or Mac: [Installtion Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wiWmSw-t3PIkFtu4hDhAmWykpleA3h-he3AaDb1Fq4A/edit?usp=sharing)

## Getting the Code

Link to the starter code: https://github.com/CSE12-F20-Assignments/cse12-fa20-pa0-Setup-starter

Note that it is in a Github repository. There are two easy ways to download the starter files.

1. Download as a ZIP folder 

    After going to the Github repository, you should see a green button that says *Code*. Click on that button. Then click on *Download ZIP*. This should download all the files as a ZIP folder. You can then unzip/extract the zip bundle and move it to wherever you would like to work.

2. Using git clone (requires terminal/command line)

    After going to the Github repository, you should see a green button that says *Code*. Click on that button. You should see something that says *Clone with HTTPS*. Copy the link that is in that section. In terminal/command line, navigate to whatever folder/directory you would like to work. Type the command `git clone _` where the `_` is replaced with the link you copied. This should clone the repository on your computer and you can then edit the files on whatever IDE you see fit.
    
If you are unsure or have questions about how to get the starter code, feel free to make a Piazza post or ask a tutor for help.



## Running an Eclipse Project
Open Eclipse and wait for it to prompt you to select a workspace. Click `launch` after you naivagate to the folder in which you want to host your eclipse projects. For example, this can be a new folder labeled 'CSE12Projects' on your Desktop. Now click the `Import existing projects` where you will click browse to select a folder for the root directory. Be sure to select the same folder that was produced from unzipping/cloning the project in the previous section. Now click on the drop down arrows to reveal the file contents of pa0-starter. Continue this until you find the file labeled 'HelloWorld.java'. Double click on the file to open it in the editor. To run it, simply right click (Mac: control+click) on the file and select 'Run As' and then select 'Java Application'. You should now see "Hello World!" printed to the eclipse console. You have successfully ran a program on eclipse!
